# Digital Forensics Assignment: Oil Company Case
## Scenario

### Background

An oil company's senior management suspects that John Smith, one of their mechanical engineers, has allegedly taken information clearly identified as proprietary. The suspicion has led to an internal investigation approved by both the senior management and the legal office.

### Company Policies

All employees are required to sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) and acceptable use policies (AUPs) before gaining access to company information. John Smith was not authorized to access the proprietary information, making this a potential violation of company policies.

### The Request

The company's legal office has officially requested a digital forensics investigation to gather digital evidence of this potential policy violation.

### Your Role

As a member of the investigative team, you are tasked with developing an investigative plan of action to collect digital evidence and provide recommendations for the case.
