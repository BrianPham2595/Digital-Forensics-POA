## Investigation Planning
Our team aims to conduct a discreet, low-impact investigation. Activities will be planned for non-peak hours to minimize business disruption. Information will be shared only with those directly involved in the case for confidentiality. Authenticated duplicates of original data will be used for investigation, allowing normal operations to continue without alerting the suspect. Team members will be rigorously vetted, and a dual-control system will be in place to safeguard the process. 

To maximize the collection of evidence, we will implement a multi-layered approach. First, we will capture 'live' data from operational systems, which often contain volatile, time-sensitive information crucial for our investigation. This will be complemented by acquiring stored data from shut-down devices to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Utilized Tools
Our team will utilize specialized tools for a comprehensive investigation. FTK will be employed for disk imaging and data analysis, Wireshark for network traffic review, and Sysinternals Suite for real-time system monitoring. To maintain evidence integrity, we will make bit-by-bit copies of relevant data and conduct a thorough analysis of system and application logs to identify any unauthorized activities.

## Evidence Handling and Preservation
When it comes to the handling and preservation of evidence, our team will adhere to best practices to ensure its integrity and admissibility. A detailed chain of custody will be documented to meticulously record every action taken during the investigation, complete with timestamps. 

To further secure the integrity of the data, cryptographic hashing techniques using SHA-256 will be employed. This ensures that the collected data remains unchanged and tamper-proof throughout the investigation process. Additionally, for physical storage, we will implement stringent security measures to make sure that the stored data is both secure and tamper-proof.

## Efficiency Measures
For optimal efficiency in our investigation, we'll focus on categorizing and sorting the data based on its relevance to the alleged policy violations. A flagging system will further aid this sorting, allowing us to quickly identify and prioritize high-importance evidence. This streamlined approach ensures effective resource allocation and thorough examination of critical evidence.

## Conclusive Analysis
In the conclusion phase, our team will employ a detective-like scrutiny of all gathered evidence and data. We'll conduct timestamp analysis to clarify the timing of events and identify involved parties. 

The investigation will also probe into the intent behind the actionsâ€”whether they were premeditated or accidental. As a final step, we'll cross-reference our findings with the specific company policies and clauses violated, including NDAs and AUPs.

## Final Reporting
Our final report will strike a balance between simplicity and detail, outlining key findings and recommendations in a format easily understood by the requestors of the investigation. Legal ramifications will be clearly outlined, and we will address questions and concerns before commencing with next steps.
